# Hi, I'm Beulah 👋

I'm a curious developer based in Cape Town with a growing interest in **data science**, **R**, and the evolving role of **AI in software development**. I enjoy solving real-world problems with code, exploring new tools, and building things that are both useful and a little bit fun.

I come from a background working with **web technologies** like PHP, Angular, and SQL, and I’ve been expanding into cloud (AWS), frontend frameworks, and more recently, AI-assisted coding workflows.

When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me making art, deep-diving into random Wikipedia articles, or getting lost on long walks.

## 🛠️ What I'm Working With

**Languages & Tools**  
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- R (learning in progress)  
- Python  
- SQL  
- PHP  
- C, C++  
- HTML / CSS  
- Angular, React  
- Firebase  
- AWS (core services)  

**Currently Exploring**  
- Data science with R & Python  
- AI tools for coding, test writing, and automation  
- Cloud workflows & architecture (especially with AWS)  
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code

## 🧠 Projects & Interests

I'm especially interested in how we can use AI to write better code, faster — not just automating tasks, but improving how we think and work as developers. You'll find some experiments and sandbox projects around that here on my GitHub.
